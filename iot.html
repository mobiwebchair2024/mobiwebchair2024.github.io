<p><b>Abstract</b>: The nexus of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) allows sensing and actuation to be performed in our personal, social, and physical spaces in previously unimagined ways. Deep learning methods deployed across the edge-cloud continuum enable IoT systems to make accurate predictions and decisions from high-dimensional and unstructured real-world sensory data while benefiting from the high-performance tensor operations in hardware accelerators. As a result, in many settings, DNNs have entirely replaced symbolic and mechanistic approaches based on algorithms, scientific models, and human knowledge. However, the benefits come with considerably reduced abilities to generalize to new situations, to assure trustworthiness, and to reason about complex spatiotemporal events that require connecting the dots across large spans of time and space. We will present emerging neuro-symbolic approaches that seek to overcome this tension by integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning. The former allows efficient processing of multimodal sensory inputs to create precepts that assist reasoning and the latter provides interpretability, enforces constraints, allows for human knowledge injection, and acts as regularizers that guide the learning of neural components. The talk will describe the unique capabilities that neuro-symbolic architectures bring to the IoT domain and the research challenges they present.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Within the military domain, the Internet of Things (IoT) may not be a new concept.  In the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has already envisioned a future battlefield by introducing a “network-centric warfare” concept by integrating the physical, information and cognitive domains for efficient information sharing and collaboration in the contested DIL (disconnected, intermittent, and low-bandwidth) environments.  Since then, Network-centric operational concepts (CONOPs) have been a driving force behind recent defense transformation and led to the adoption of IoT-related technologies primarily in the area of C4ISR systems. This has served as the foundation of IoT and paved the way for Tactical IoT (a.k.a., Internet of Battlefield Things, IoBT) concept.  The U.S. Army Research Lab (ARL) created the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) project in 2016 and its IoBT Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA) research consortium in 2017 to advance the theoretical foundation and accelerate development of IoBT systems. Boeing Research &amp; Technology (BR&amp;T) has been conducting extensive researches on Tactical Mobile Networking for C4ISR applications for the last two decades or more. In this talk, decades of research works, solutions and lessons on tactical mobile networking at BR&amp;T will be presented, focusing on Tactical Edge Networks, Adaptive MANET, to Software Defined Network (SDN), Communications as a Service (CaaS), and recent AI-based Network projects. Finally, the IoBT-related ongoing research projects, for example, UAV Swarm Communication and Anomaly Detection, Air Launch Effect (ALE) Platform-to-Platform communications, Network Digital Twins for IoBT, under Boeing’s Strategic Universities Alliance Program will be introduced.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Recent years have witnessed the emergence of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) as new clinical instruments for precision medicine. IoMT is driven by growing adoption of wearable devices and advancement in machine learning. While wearable devices allow unobtrusive monitoring of patients outside clinical environments, machine learning enables predicting clinical outcomes based on longitudinal wearable data. However, to realize its potential in precision medicine, IoMT must overcome three key challenges: (1) extracting reliable clinical information from noisy and lossy wearable data, (2) building robust predictive models with limited training data, (3) personalized prediction of treatment outcome. To tackle these challenges in real-world clinical studies, we first present a robust machine learning pipeline tailored for wearable data collected in daily life. We will then explore multi-task machine learning models for personalized predictions of treatment outcomes based on wearable and clinical data collected from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in two real-world clinical trials using Fitbit wristbands. In the first trial, we applied the machine learning pipeline to predict post-operative complications and hospital readmissions of patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. In the second trial, we trained the multi-task model using data from an RCT to predict depression remission of patient with and without an integrated intervention treatment. Results from the clinical studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the machine learning pipeline in improving predictive accuracy in the presence of significant noise and missing data collected by wearables. Furthermore, machine learning provides a promising approach to utilizing data collected in RCTs to develop predictive models for precision medicine. The talk will conclude by highlighting opportunities and directions in advancing IoMT as a vital instrument for precision medicine.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Modern IoT systems are decentralized across wide areas, make use of advanced and complex AI/ML algorithms, and face challenging resource and connectivity constraints. These properties make it difficult for operators and developers to debug and diagnose problems when they occur, leading to vulnerabilities, management challenges, outages, and poor performance. In this talk, I will explore the use of &ldquo;digital twinning&rdquo;, a technique which has been used in other fields of engineering to improve reliability with great success, to solve these problems. In particular, I will present a distributed run-time layer approach for IoT-based digital twinning. It makes use of virtualization technologies, formal methods, and optimization algorithms to construct, manipulate, and automatically test and tune cloud-hosted virtual representations of IoT deployments. I&rsquo;ll discuss several challenges and solutions towards achieving this goal, as well as use cases and future directions in this emerging area of research.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things has a problem: batteries. They are bulky, a pain to replace, and hard to dispose of. Ambient energy harvesting may come to the rescue by providing theoretically unlimited energy supplies. Extreme energy scarcity, however, often causes executions to become intermittent, requiring new hardware and software designs. Several works studied the leap from a traditional execution model to an intermittent one, yet their practical application in real-world scenarios is limited. Through first-hand experience in multi-year deployments of battery-less systems, we argue that the virtuous cycle of theoretical investigation, system implementation, and real-world deployment must be applied to intermittent computing as well, or its potential is bound to remain unexpressed.</p>
